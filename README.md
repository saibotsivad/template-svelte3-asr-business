# Template: Svelte with abstract-state-router

This is a project template for projects that use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [asr](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router).

The primary focus is on webapps that do not need to focus on first-load primarily.

Start a project:

```bash
npx degit saibotsivad/template-svelte3-asr-business my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```
